    <h1>Scientists Discover 2 Drugs That Can End Lower Back Pain</h1>
    <img src="./back-pain.jpg.avif" width="1300" alt="">
    <p>A recent preclinical study led by researchers at McGill University has identified two promising drug candidates—o-Vanillin and RG-7112—that could tackle chronic low back pain at its source by eliminating senescent cells, also known as “zombie cells,” from spinal discs.</p>
    <p>These aged or damaged cells accumulate over time, contributing to inflammation, tissue breakdown, and persistent pain. Unlike standard treatments that only alleviate symptoms, this new approach aims to treat the underlying cause of back pain.</p>
    <h2>Key Highlights:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Targeting the Source:</strong> The research focuses on senescent cells that build up in spinal discs with aging or injury, triggering ongoing pain and inflammation.</li>
        <li><strong>Stronger Together: </strong>While both drugs showed positive effects when administered individually, the most significant improvements occurred when they were combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Effective Oral Delivery:</strong>Administered by mouth, the drugs successfully reached spinal discs—an area typically difficult to treat—and helped reverse damage.
</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Promising Preclinical Results</h2>
    <p>The drugs were tested on mice and led to a noticeable reduction in pain and inflammation. After eight weeks of oral treatment, researchers observed not only relief of symptoms but also signs of disc regeneration.</p>
    <p>“This could be a game-changer,” said Professor Lisbet Haglund, senior author of the study and co-director of the Orthopaedic Research Laboratory at Montreal General Hospital. “Instead of masking the pain, we’re directly addressing the cells that cause it.”</p>
    <p>The study was conducted by the Alan Edwards Centre for Research on Pain at McGill, in collaboration with the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC).</p>
    <h2>Surprising Role of a Natural Compound</h2>
    <p>Interestingly, o-Vanillin—a compound derived from turmeric—was not initially a central part of the experiment. The team added it as an exploratory measure due to its known anti-inflammatory effects. The results showed, for the first time, that o-Vanillin may effectively eliminate senescent cells from spinal tissue.</p>
    <p>RG-7112, already recognized for its role in cancer and osteoarthritis research, also showed strong potential in this new context. Together, the two drugs proved more effective than either alone.</p>
    <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
    <p>Researchers now aim to improve o-Vanillin’s formulation to increase its retention and effectiveness in the body. They also believe this approach could be used to treat other conditions caused by senescent cells, such as arthritis and osteoporosis.</p>
