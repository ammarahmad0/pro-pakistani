    <h1>Ammad Butt Calls Silver Medal a Symbol of Hockey’s Revival</h1>
    <img src="./ammad-butt.jpg.avif" width="1400" alt="">
    <p>Pakistan captain Ammad Butt has struck a defiant and heartfelt note following his side’s loss to New Zealand in the final of the FIH Nations Cup, declaring that while the team fell short of gold, they succeeded in something far more significant: reigniting belief in Pakistani hockey.</p>
    <p>In a powerful statement issued after the 6-2 defeat in Kuala Lumpur, Butt emphasized that the silver medal represented more than just a podium finish. It was, in his words, “a symbol of hope, confidence and passion.”

“We have not lost; we have won hearts,” said Butt. “We have revived hockey.”</p>
<p>After years of turmoil, administrative crises, and on-field setbacks — some of which continued during this tournament — the Pakistan hockey team’s campaign represented a significant step forward for a once-mighty force in global hockey.</p>
<p>“Playing the final after 11 years was not just a milestone,” Butt said. “We gave the message that Pakistan hockey is waking up again.”</p>
<p>The Nations Cup not only offered silverware but also served as a pathway to the prestigious FIH Pro League. Although Pakistan fell just short of reclaiming a seat at the top table, they showcased renewed structure, fighting spirit, and a long-absent cohesion on the pitch.</p>
<p>Butt, who led from the front throughout the campaign, remained optimistic about what lies ahead.

“The trophy definitely slipped from our hands, but the fire and passion to win it is stronger than ever,” he said. “This is not the end, but the beginning of a new chapter in Pakistan hockey.”</p>
<p>He concluded with a word of thanks for both his teammates and the public, whose support he credited as a major source of motivation throughout the campaign.</p>
<p>“We will fight for Pakistan hockey till our last breath,” Butt vowed.

While challenges across the board still plague Pakistan hockey, the captain’s resolve to lead the team out of this dark period offers hope. With renewed optimism and public support, there is a growing belief that the glory days of Pakistani hockey may not be too far off once again.</p>
