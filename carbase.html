The app allows officers to view complete vehicle data and any outstanding e-challans simply by taking a photo of the vehicle. It is being linked with the existing Wardens App.</p>
<p>Previously, this functionality was only available through LT wireless sets. Under the older system, wardens had to stop vehicles and manually input the vehicle number, chassis number, or ID card details. With the new photo-based feature, recovery is expected to improve and more vehicles can be checked in less time.</p>
<p>Dr. Waheed stated that daily recovery has increased from Rs. 500,000 to Rs. 5 million within a month. Of the Rs. 9.4 million in outstanding dues from government vehicles, Rs. 3.5 million was recovered in just one month.

He also revealed that special teams were formed to recover Rs. 6 billion in pending e-challan dues</p>
